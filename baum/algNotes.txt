probability of a particular transition at a particular location:
probability (given the data and transition/emission probabilities) that our hidden markov model is in state k at pos i and state l at position i+1
= (forward(seq,transD)[k,i]*transD[k at i and l at i+1]*1*backward(seq,transD)[l,i+1]) / P(x)

For each key in the transition matrix (every possible transition of states):
ex. Ac
At each position i where a transition might occur (so all places with AC in the data)
Calculate forward(seq,transD)[N,i]*transD[N at i and I at i+1]*1*backward(seq,transD)[I,i+1])
Sum all of these together and divide by P(x)
This gets you the expected count for this transition  

Updating the transition probabilities based on trnasition counts:
transition probability for state k going to l = countMatrix[k,l]/sum of expected counts of k to any state q

Stop when likelihood reaches some criterion (chich is what? and how do we calculate likelihood?)
